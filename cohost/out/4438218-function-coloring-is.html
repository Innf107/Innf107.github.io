        <p>So, one thought I’ve been having a lot recently regarding “function
coloring” is that I really do not believe that async functions being
colored at all is the issue. I actually think it’s good!</p>
<p>Really, what I think is a lot more relevant is that languages with
async/await typically have <em>two</em> ways of doing IO: one that is
sync and untagged and one that is async and tagged. This means that even
functions that are intended to do IO are usually written as sync
functions by default and so of course doing something asynchronous
somewhere contaminates most of the codebase with “unnecessary” async
functions.</p>
<p>If all IO in a language were async, I really don’t think people would
complain about coloring nearly as much as they do, since it would be
pretty obvious ahead of time if a function needs to be async or not. If
you’re calling a function that doesn’t seem like it should read from or
write to files but in reality it calls a function that does, <em>that’s
an issue</em>! You would <em>want</em> your compiler to prevent you from
doing that, wouldn’t you?</p>
<p>In fact, Haskell’s IO monad kind of works like that and it’s great!
This isn’t quite a fair comparison since Haskell’s notion of IO is a lot
broader than the one used by async, but I still think it shows that the
coloring itself is not the issue.</p>
