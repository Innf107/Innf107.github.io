        <p>Hear me out, I swear the title makes sense!</p>
<p>What I mean is that tuples should have the same <em>laziness
characteristics</em> as newtypes, just extended to more than one
element.</p>
<p>I’ll explain what this means in a second, but let’s get everyone on
the same page about laziness semantics first. Laziness is usually
“measured” by including a sort of pseudo-value representing
non-terminating expressions, i.e. infinite loops or imprecise
exceptions. For contrived plot reasons, this value is called “bottom” or
⊥. If a data constructor is lazy in its argument (and therefore needs to
allocate a thunk at runtime), that is equivalent to saying that the
argument can be bottom.</p>
<p>Now, let’s say we have two independent expressions of type
<code>a</code> and <code>b</code> respectively. What values can those
have? Well, each one can either be bottom or a value of type
<code>a</code> or <code>b</code> (which might contain more bottoms but
we don’t care about those here) so they can be any of the following four
possibilities.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>a</th>
<th>b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>⊥</td>
<td>⊥</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>a</td>
<td>⊥</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>⊥</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>a</td>
<td>b</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>There shouldn’t be any surprises so far, so let’s look at the values
of a tuple of type <code>(a, b)</code>. Operationally, a tuple is really
just two values glued together so any reasonable programmer would expect
this to look almost identical to the table above, right?</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>(a, b)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>⊥</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>(⊥, ⊥)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>(a, ⊥)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>(⊥, b)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>(a, b)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>No! This table has 5 rows but the previous one only had 4! The tuple
constructor has added another case (<code>⊥</code>) on top of combining
the laziness of the two subexpressions.</p>
<p>Written out like this, the difference might seem pretty abstract, but
it can be a real source of space leaks!</p>
<h2 id="laziness-bad-just-use-a-strict-tuple">Laziness bad, just use a
strict tuple</h2>
<p>I said the magic word, so you’re probably already dying to tell me to
add strictness annotations to our tuple type to make it less lazy. Well,
let’s try that!</p>

<p>Okay, our tuple is now strict in both values so let’s see how that
affects laziness</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Pair a b</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>⊥</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Pair a b</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Oh no, that is not what we want! We got rid of three rows instead of
one and now our a and b are linked together. There is no way to evaluate
one without also forcing evaluation of the other. This might be a
reasonable data structure in many cases, but it’s definitely not what
the default tuple in a lazy language should look like.</p>
<p>So is there a way to get rid of <em>only</em> the initial ⊥ row
<em>without</em> affecting the rest?</p>
<h2 id="yes-unboxed-tuples">Yes! Unboxed tuples!</h2>
<p>If we have an <em>unboxed</em> tuple, it is not a lifted type, so it
cannot be bottom and therefore has the exact same laziness
characteristics (and almost the same runtime representation!) as our two
independent expressions from the beginning</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>(# a, b #)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>(# ⊥, ⊥ #)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>(# a, ⊥ #)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>(# ⊥, b #)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>(# a, b #)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Buuut we pay a price. Because this type cannot be bottom (it is
“unlifted”) and it has a different runtime representation than regular
types, it doesn’t have kind <code>Type</code>, but
<code>TYPE (TupleRep [LiftedRep, LiftedRep])</code>. This means that it
pretty much cannot participate in regular polymorphism at all.</p>
<p>So even this is not a solution for regular Haskell programs, despite
having the exact laziness profile we are after.</p>
<h2 id="well-what-would-the-ideal-tuple-look-like-then">Well, what would
the ideal tuple look like then?</h2>
<p>We cannot remove the initial ⊥ row since we still want our tuple to
be lifted and we cannot touch the individual components since they
should retain their own laziness. But there is another row that is
entirely redundant! Tuples only have a single constructor, so there is
really no reason to treat (⊥, ⊥) and ⊥ differently. If we could just get
rid of the (⊥, ⊥) row, effectively ignoring the <code>(,)</code>
constructor and only focusing on its components, our tuple would behave
exactly like two independent values without sacrificing its kind.</p>
<h2 id="hey-remember-the-title">Hey, remember the title?</h2>
<p>Newtypes, by virtue of being erased at runtime, behave
<em>exactly</em> like their underlying types with regards to
laziness.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Identity a</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>⊥</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Identity a</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Because newtype constructors don’t actually exist, they don’t show up
in laziness profiles. That’s exactly how we want tuples to behave, just
with more than one underlying value!</p>
<p>Now wouldn’t it be nice if GHC actually let us do this :)</p>
