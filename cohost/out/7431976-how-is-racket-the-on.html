        <p>“Programming paradigms” are a pretty vague and frankly not very
meaningful concept but if you’re going to argue that your programming
language supports both imperative and functional programming, you’ll at
the very least have to give me access to mutable <em>and</em> persistent
data structures.</p>
<p>Racket does this quite nicely by giving you two mostly compatible
versions of each (e.g. <code>hash</code> creates an immutable hash table
and <code>make-hash</code> creates a mutable one but you can access both
with <code>hash-ref</code>) but that’s kind of… it?</p>
<p>Some Haskell packages work like this (notably vector) but overall the
support for good mutable data structures there is pretty lacking.</p>
<p>OCaml likes to pretend that it’s good at this but it actually only
has some fundamental data structures that are immutable (e.g. lists,
sets) and some that are mutable (e.g. arrays, queues). This means that
e.g. because there are no immutable arrays, there is also no fast
slicing operation on arrays and so you’ll pretty much be forced to use a
more imperative style with them because you can’t even write a generic
function on arrays without passing around indices like a
Neanderthal.</p>
<p>And functional JS makes you do linear time slicing/concatenation on
mutable arrays in a loop :)</p>
