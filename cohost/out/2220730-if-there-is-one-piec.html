        <p><strong>Be <em>very</em> explicit about the difference between type
variables, unification variables and skolems</strong></p>
<p><strong>Type variables</strong> are always bound by
<code>forall</code>s and represent variables that can be instantiated to
any possible concrete type. For example,
<code>forall a. a -&gt; a</code> can be instantiated to
<code>Int -&gt; Int</code>, <code>String -&gt; String</code> or
<code>Bool -&gt; Bool</code></p>
<p><strong>Unification variables</strong> are placeholders that stand
for as of yet unknown concrete types. These usually originate from
usages of polymorphic types (where type variables are instantiated with
<strong>fresh(!!!)</strong> unification variables at every use site,
since every use site instantiates the type variable to a possibly
different concrete type, but which one that is might not be known yet),
but they are more generally useful in places where a type is needed that
might not be fully known yet (e.g. unannotated lambda parameters or
recursive let bindings)</p>
<p><strong>Skolems</strong> on the other hand are type constants that
are only equal to themselves. These are needed when <em>checking
against</em> polymorphic types. The idea is that a function with type
<code>forall a. a -&gt; a</code> cannot make any assumptions about the
type of its parameter, which is ensured by checking it against the type
<code>#a -&gt; #a</code> (where <code>#a</code> is a fresh skolem).</p>
<p>These three are often confused since they could all reasonably be
called “type variables”, but doing so will only bring you pain. They are
distinct concepts and should really be treated as such.</p>
<p>Unfortunately GHC is not great at this. In error messages,
unification variables are <em>usually</em> displayed with a trailing
number (<code>a0</code>), although something like <code>a1</code> can
either be a unification variable or a skolem if just <code>a</code>
would be ambiguous. The only way to tell which one it is is by looking
for <code>'a1' is a rigid type variable bound by...</code> (you know, in
the section of the error that noone actually reads because it’s massive
and almost never useful)</p>
