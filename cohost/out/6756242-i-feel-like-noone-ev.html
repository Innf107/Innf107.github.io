        <p>And that is that effect-polymorphic functions can also be used as
pure functions.</p>
<p>In Haskell, where we use Monads, the universe is essentially split in
two: there are pure functions like map, fold, filter and then there are
monadic versions of the same functions that are polymorphic over some
monad (or Applicative) like mapM/traverse, foldM, filterM/wither.</p>
<p>This isn’t as bad as it sounds since it is still possible to recover
the pure variant by instantiating the monad with <code>Identity</code>,
but this requires some wrapping/unwrapping so in practice there are
usually still pure variants defined for every effect-polymorphic
function and, crucially, <strong>functions are pure instead of
effect-polymorphic by default</strong>.</p>
<p>With direct style effects, there usually isn’t much a a reason
<em>not</em> to define effect-polymorphic functions unless they actually
<em>have</em> to be pure, so programmers should pretty much never be
limited by libraries not exposing an effectful version of some function
and library authors shouldn’t even have to think about exposing
effect-polymorphic variants.</p>
