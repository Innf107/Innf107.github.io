        <span class="date">29 July 2024</span>        
        <p>A lot of people think that functional programming is mostly about
avoiding mutation at all costs. Even though persistent data structures
<em>are</em> great and there is definitely some truth to it, this view
just doesn’t really hold up in reality.</p>
<p>Many data structures fundamentally require some form of mutation
(e.g. union find) and even something simple like a persistent sequential
data structure that allows both fast appends and fast random access is
orders of magnitude more complicated and still slower than a naive
dynamic mutable array.</p>
<p>So really, functional languages need to allow mutation in some way if
they don’t want nearly every program to suffer from completely
unnecessary overhead in terms of both time and implementation
complexity.</p>
<p>Existing languages have a few options here but I don’t think any of
these are good enough.</p>
<h2 id="option-1-give-up">Option 1: Give up</h2>
<p>This is the most common and obvious option: just allow programmers to
use mutable data structures like they would in an imperative
language.</p>
<p>While this has the advantage of being relatively straight-forward and
quite flexible, I really don’t think it is the way to go. The
fundamental problem with this approach is that arguably the main reason
to use a functional language in the first place is that you
<em>don’t</em> want to have to watch out for accidental side effects and
accidental mutation.</p>
<p>But if your language has unrestricted mutable data structures, the
desire not to worry about mutation outweighs the benefits of using a
mutable data structure so they will typically only be used as a last
resort and mostly in really simple scenarios where it is easy to
manually verify that no mutation leaks outside some interface boundary.
(a function, module, etc.)</p>
<p>For example, let’s say you’re iterating over some structure and
collecting your results in a sequence. The most efficient data structure
to use here would be a mutable dynamic array and in an imperative
language that’s what pretty much everyone would use.</p>
<p>But if you asked an OCaml programmer, they would almost certainly use
a linked list instead. This isn’t because they’re stupid or they don’t
care about performance but because the additional mental overhead of
worrying about mutation outweighs the benefits of using a more efficient
data structure.</p>
<p>And that’s a language failure! A good programming language shouldn’t
make you write worse code just because it’s too limited to express the
better alternative nicely.</p>
<h2 id="option-1.1-give-up-but-only-in-io">Option 1.1: Give up but only
in IO</h2>
<p>If your language has some way of tracking side effects, you can give
programmers full access to mutable data structures but only in a context
where they can already use unrestricted side effects.</p>
<p>Regardless of which other option a language chooses, I think having
<em>some</em> form of unrestricted mutation for those cases where you do
need the flexibility is important and in my opinion, this is the best
way to achieve that.</p>
<p>That said, because using mutation is now reflected in the function’s
type and infects all call sites, the problems from the previous section
are massively excacerbated so this option is <em>only</em> suitable as a
last resort or for programs that already mostly run in IO.</p>
<h2 id="option-2-locally-sourced-mutation-only">Option 2: Locally
sourced mutation only</h2>
<p>One way to make mutation compatible with functional programming is to
make sure that it is limited in scope and that no mutable state ever
escapes a region. This is how Haskell’s <a
href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Control-Monad-ST.html#t:ST">ST</a>
Monad and Koka’s <a
href="https://koka-lang.github.io/koka/doc/book.html#sec-runst">st</a>
effect work. If no mutable state can leak, this means that the mutation
becomes an implementation detail and from outside the region where
mutation is allowed, the computation behaves exactly as if it were
completely pure.</p>
<p>If you know me, you might know that I really like this approach in
principle.</p>
<p>But I almost never use it in practice.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why might just be the Haskell implementation,
which employs very little dedicated language support (as opposed to
something like <a href="https://flix.dev/">Flix</a> that presumably does
a lot more inference), but in any case, annotating lifetimes is tedious
enough that if you have something mutable inside a lot of structure,
it’s often easier to write the module that uses it in IO and make sure
manually that it doesn’t leak. And if you only need mutation locally
inside a function, using <code>ST</code> makes your code fundamentally
more imperative in a way that really forces you to change your
programming style. This isn’t great either and doesn’t exactly help with
readability, so the mental overhead is rarely worth it.</p>
<h2 id="option-3-you-can-only-read-this-section-once">Option 3: You can
only read this section once</h2>
<p>Another way to use mutation without compromising on purity is to make
sure you’re never reusing a value after you have modified it. This is
called <strong>linearity</strong><a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. In this case, there is
no way to observe whether a data structure is persistent or mutable
because to find out you would have to look at it after you’ve modified
it!</p>
<p>So now all your linear data structures can have APIs that look
exactly like their persistent counterparts (aside from some linearity
bookkeping) but internally they will mutate the data structure
in-place.</p>
<p>In theory, this sounds amazing and it is probably the best option
presented here (also currently the least well-supported one in practice)
but it still has problems.</p>
<p>One issue is that it’s not always easy to write linear code. For
example, while needing exclusive access to <em>write</em> to a linear
data structure is quite natural, you’ll typically want to be able to
share it for reading. There are nice solutions to this, such as Rust’s
shared XOR mutable references<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> but once you go down
that path, you add some complexity and lose the ability to write code as
if your data structures were fully persistent.</p>
<p>But what’s much more problematic in my opinion is that linearity is
extremely infectious.</p>
<p>You can add linearity as an opt-in feature (like in current Haskell)
such that you only need to worry about it if you need it. Unfortunately,
this makes it impossible to use <em>any</em> standard functions like
<code>map</code> on linear values and either makes linearity nearly
useless or inevitably creates a parallel, incomplete universe of
functions that also work on linear values.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can make linearity the default and give every
standard function a type that respects linearity. Now linearity works
great and is really easy to use! However, now everyone needs to worry
about linearity all the time since e.g. changing a function from using
an argument linearly to non-linearly is a breaking change. This also
means that to be compatible with the rest of the ecosystem, every
polymorphic function needs to be written as if its arguments were
linear.</p>
<p>The same problem occurs with tracked effects although I think it’s a
lot easier to justify there since effects are something you’ll want to
think about in a functional language anyway.</p>
<p>If you go down this path you might even run into this issue with
linearity <em>and</em> effects at the same time.</p>
<h2 id="option-4-functional-farming">Option 4: Functional farming</h2>
<p>After the last section, you might have had an idea: if explictly
tracking linearity is difficult but most programs that would benefit
from it are effectively linear already, why don’t we implicitly track
linearity at runtime and just perform a copy if we have more than one
reference? Well, that’s exactly what Koka’s Functional But In-Place
(FBIP) and Swift’s Copy-on-Write (CoW) data structures do!</p>
<p>The advantage of this is that it’s pretty much invisible from the
surface. This time, your program actually looks exactly as if it were
just using persistent data structures so you won’t run into any of the
virality issues you have with linearity. Koka can even infer a lot of
this for you and perform in-place updates on seemingly immutable data
structures.</p>
<p>This might sound a little dangerous since accidentally holding on to
a reference could turn a linear time algorithm quadratic, but it’s
actually a lot less problematic than it sounds! If there are two
references to a data structure and one is modified, it will create its
own <em>unique</em> copy and let go of the previous one, so any further
modification to either reference can be performed in-place again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this approach has a different, much more fundamental
fatal flaw, that makes it unsuitable for most programming languages: It
relies on reference counting.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to tell that a data structure is used more
than once at runtime, you need some way to keep track of references. A
tracing garbage collector just doesn’t give you this sort of
information.</p>
<p>There are some <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2020/11/perceus-tr-v1.pdf">nice
efforts into making reference counting more competitive for this kind of
workload</a> but at least for now even these <a
href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1anyq4j/comment/kpx1t56/">struggle
to keep up with tracing garbage collectors even when factoring in
automatic reuse analysis</a>.</p>
<p>Reference counting might work for some languages, especially ones
that don’t care much about parallelism, but it’s just not a realistic
default.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-do-we-do-about-this">So, what do we do about this?</h2>
<p>Honestly, I don’t know.</p>
<p>Linearity is the most promising option out of the ones presented, but
unless we find an answer to the virality problem, I doubt we will ever
see it in more than a few semi-popular functional programming
languages.</p>
<p>I think there is room for a fundamentally new approach here, I’m just
not sure what that would look like.</p>
<p>Alternatively, some way to integrate regions more nicely with regular
functional programming would probably help a ton.</p>
<p>A capable solution should also be compatible with existing state
management solutions. It shouldn’t be easier to use a State monad/effect
over a persistent data structure than to use a proper mutable data
structure.</p>
