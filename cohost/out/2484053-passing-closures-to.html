        <p>One of the key features of Polaris is that it supports calling other
programs as a language construct rather than a function (like Bash, but
unlike, say, <code>os.system</code> in Python). This sounds like it
wouldn’t make much of a difference beyond ergonomics, but it actually
gives the interpreter the freedom to do a few things that would be
impossible to do from inside the language. This is one of those!</p>
<p>Some CLI programs accept programs as callbacks that they will run at
some point. E.g. <code>watch</code>, <code>entr</code>. Using these in a
bash script means writing the callback to a separate file and passing
the name of that file —­ not too painful, but you’re already using bash
so the bar is pretty low.</p>
<p>Polaris on the other hand supports, you know, <em>actual
functions</em>. So wouldn’t it be nice if we could just pass one of
those to a program call? Imagine the possibilities if we could write
programs like this</p>
<pre><code>let counter = ref 0

!watch (\_ -&gt; {
    print(counter!)
    counter := counter! + 1
    0
})</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-on-earth-are-you-going-to-implement-this">How on earth are
you going to implement this?</h2>
<p>Great question! Here is where it gets fun.</p>
<p>Every time we pass a function to a program call, the interpreter
<em>actually</em> creates a shell script in a new temporary directory
and passes its path to the program call. This shell script then
communicates with the main polaris process through <a
href="https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/mkfifo.3.html">named pipe
files</a>, sending stdin and receiving stdout. There, the polaris
runtime creates a new async task that evaluates the closure with the
correct stdin and stdout.</p>
<p>Importantly, this will <em>not</em> work with programs that somehow
modify the execution context such as <code>chroot</code> or
<code>env</code>. Maybe it should though? It might be possible to run
every IO operation in the child script.</p>
