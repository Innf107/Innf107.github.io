        <span class="date">27 August 2023</span>        
        <p>With a constraint based type checker, the order in which constraints
are solved should generally not matter. This is called confluence and it
is a pretty important property, since it ensures that the constraint
solver can process constraints out of order and apply a whole bunch of
other clever optimizations. It also makes the type system much more
predictable for programmers.</p>
<p>But… currently changing the order in which constraints in Polaris are
solved can infer wildly different types and that is pretty bad.</p>
<h2 id="the-culprit-program-argument-constraints">The culprit: program
argument constraints</h2>
<p>One of the more fundamental features of Polaris are program calls.
For example <code>!ls</code> is an expression that runs the program
<code>ls</code> and returns it’s output. Of course, programs can also
take arguments, but what types should those arguments have? In the end,
the operating system is only going to pass strings, but in polaris,
lists of strings (and lists of lists of … of lists of strings), numbers
and even <a
href="https://cohost.org/prophet/post/2484053-passing-closures-to">functions</a>
are all valid program arguments. This is achieved by emitting a
<code>ProgArg</code> constraint for the type of each argument, which is
resolved correctly and quite elegantly for all of the above types.</p>
<p>There is just one catch: What if the argument type is an unsolved
unification variable? For example, what should the type of the following
function be?</p>
<pre><code>let f(x) = !ls x</code></pre>
<p><code>!ls</code> returns a string, but we know nothing about its
argument other than that it has a <code>ProgArg</code> constraint. We
cannot solve the constraint, so we should emit an ambiguity error and
reject the program.</p>
<p>But that’s stupid! <em>Obviously</em>, the most natural type for this
function is <code>String -&gt; String</code> and that is almost surely
what the programmer meant when they wrote it.</p>
<p>So what polaris currently does is that, if the constraint solver
fails to make progress, it <em>defaults</em> <code>ProgArg</code>
constraints to <code>String</code>, correctly inferring
<code>f : String -&gt; String</code> for this example.</p>
<h2 id="this-defaulting-breaks-confluence">This defaulting breaks
confluence</h2>
<p>This is easier to explain if we assume Polaris had functional
dependencies (which it might get at some point). Non-confluence should
manifest without them as well, but even if it doesn’t, that just delays
the issue.</p>
<p>Let’s say, we define a type class <code>C</code> with two functional
dependencies on it’s arguments</p>
<pre><code>class C(a, b) | a -&gt; b, b -&gt; a
instance C(String, Number)
instance C(List(String), String)</code></pre>
<p>What this effectively means is that a constraint
<code>C(String, x)</code> implies <code>x ~ Number</code> and
<code>C(y, String)</code> implies <code>y ~ List(String)</code> (and
vice versa).</p>
<p>Okay, now imagine we task our constraint solver with solving this
sequence of constraints</p>
<pre><code>1: ProgArg(?a)
2: C(?a, ?b)
3: ProgArg(?b)</code></pre>
<p>None of these can be solved directly, so our constraint solver will
fail to make progress and start defaulting program arguments.</p>
<p>If it starts with constraint (1), it will default
<code>?a ~ String</code>. This unblocks the second constraint, now
<code>C(String, ?b)</code>, which will be solved by our first instance
and imply <code>?b ~ Number</code>. Constraint (3) is just
<code>ProgArg(Number)</code> now, which is trivially solved, leaving us
with the successful substitution</p>
<pre><code>?a := String
?b := Number</code></pre>
<p>This actually doesn’t seem too unreasonable, but now consider what
happens if our constraint solver decides to solve the constraints <em>in
reverse</em>.</p>
<p>If it starts at (3), it defaults <code>?b ~ String</code>, again
unblocking (2), but with the second instance this time. This implies
<code>?a ~ List(String)</code> now, which again leaves our third
constraint to be trivially solved as it is just
<code>ProgArg(List(String))</code> now. Therefore, our final
substitution this time is</p>
<pre><code>?a := List(String)
?b := String</code></pre>
<p>which <em>completely</em> contradicts the one from before, just
because we changed the order in which constraints were solved (or
emitted!).</p>
<h2 id="so-what-are-we-going-to-do">So what are we going to do?</h2>
<p>One solution would be to default <em>all</em> <code>ProgArg</code>
constraints at once. If we did this above, we would substitute both
<code>?a := String</code> and <code>?b := String</code>, which would
actually lead to the cosntraint solver rejecting the program above,
because the functional dependency on <code>C</code> means that
<code>C(String, String)</code> is impossible to solve.</p>
<p>This does restore confluence, however it might lead to some
<em>very</em> counter intuitive errors. Removing a type signature
somewhere might make the constraint solver give up and default a type
somewhere completely different that would have been resolved correctly
before.</p>
<p>I think there is a better way</p>
<h2 id="generalizing-program-argument-constraints">Generalizing program
argument constraints</h2>
<p>Program argument constraints predate type classes by a lot, but now
that we finally have them, we might not actually need to default program
arguments at all anymore! Remember that the entire reason we cared about
defaulting was that we wanted to infer a type for declarations like
<code>let f(x) = !ls x</code>.</p>
<p>Now that we have type classes, we can just treat program argument
constraints ~exactly like regular type class constraints and let users
abstract over them! If we do this, we don’t need to pick a concrete type
for <code>x</code>. We can just generalize the function and infer a type
<code>f : forall a. ProgArg(a) =&gt; a -&gt; String</code>.</p>
<p>Not only is this fully confluent, it also gives the programmer the
power to do much more than they could before and possibly even leaves
the door open for <em>custom</em> <code>ProgArg</code> instances in the
future!</p>
