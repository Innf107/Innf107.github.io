        <p><a
href="https://www.haskellforall.com/2021/08/namespaced-de-bruijn-indices.html">Namespaced
De Bruijn indices</a> are a really neat trick for representing names in
programming language interpreters that I learned from <span
class="citation" data-cites="fullmoon">@fullmoon</span>. In short, the
idea is pretty much that you can access shadowed variables by starting
at their last occurence and counting up. So for example, in this
code</p>
<pre><code>let x = 1
let y = 2
let x = 3
let y = 4
let x = 5</code></pre>
<p><code>x</code> (which is equivalent to <code>x@0</code>) is assigned
5, <code>x@1</code> is 3, <code>x@2</code> is 1, <code>y</code> and
<code>y@0</code> are 4 and <code>y@1</code> is 2.</p>
<p>The way Gabby uses this is mostly intended for interpreters that need
to do capture avoiding substitution. But even in a compiler, these are
actually quite useful in combination with a feature that might seem
completely unrelated at first!</p>
<h2 id="row-polymorphism-with-duplicate-labels">Row polymorphism with
duplicate labels</h2>
<p>At this point, row polymorphism isn’t actually that uncommon. It’s a
way to represent anonymous record types and abstract over the fields of
a record without needing subtyping (which would make type inference
difficult and might lose information). For example, a function that
takes any record that has an <code>x</code> field of type
<code>Int</code> and a <code>y</code> field of type <code>String</code>
and that replaces the value of <code>y</code> with something of type
<code>Bool</code> can look like this. (where <code>r</code> is the row
that represents the remaining fields)</p>
<pre><code>let f : forall r. { x : Int, y : String | r } -&gt; { x : Int, y : Bool | r }
let f(r) = { r with y = r.x &gt; 0 }</code></pre>
<p>Now, one problem that quickly comes up with row polymorphism is how
to do record extensions. It would be quite convenient to be able to
write a function that adds a field to a record like this</p>
<pre><code>let f : forall r. { | r } -&gt; { x : Int | r }
let f(r) = { r extend x =  5 }</code></pre>
<p>This seems innocent enough, but consider what happens if you call
this function on <code>{ x = "a" }</code>. The record already has an
<code>x</code> field so you can’t exactly add another, can you? You
could give up here and make the programmer ensure that <code>f</code> is
never called on a record that already has an <code>x</code> field, and
some row polymorphism implementations really do this in practice! (for
example with qualified types / type class constraints).</p>
<p>But a much more elegant answer is given in the paper <a
href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/scopedlabels.pdf">Extensible
records with scoped labels</a> that e.g. Elm and Purescript[^purescript]
are based on. Its answer to row extensions is: just allow duplicate
fields! If you apply <code>f</code> to <code>{ x = "a" }</code>, you
just get <code>{ x = 5, x = "a" }</code>, which has type
<code>{ x : Int, x : String }</code>. This means that the order of
fields is not entirely irrelevant anymore, but fortunately the type
system only needs to preserve the order of fields <em>with the same
name</em> so it’s barely noticable in practice.</p>
<p>If you paid attention, you might now be asking “how do I access the
second <code>x</code> field?”. And the traditional answer to this is:
you don’t! The row extension has shadowed the inner <code>x</code>, so
the only way to access it now is to remove the outer field. If your type
system even supports that (most don’t). Buuut…</p>
<h2 id="we-can-use-namespaced-de-bruijn-indices">We can use namespaced
De Bruijn indices!</h2>
<p>If you want to access the second <code>x</code> field of a record,
you can just write <code>r.x@1</code>! And if you want to access the,
say, 27th field, you just write <code>r.x@26</code>! This also works
seamlessly with polymorphism and type inference. For example, a generic
function like <code>f(r) = r.x@2</code> would easily be inferred to have
type
<code>f : forall r a b c. { x : a, x : b, x : c | r } -&gt; c</code>.</p>
<p>I think this is pretty cute :) [^purescript]: <del>As far as I know.
Don’t quote me on this ^^</del> Well, <a
