        <p>I get the idea but just think about what your average shell script
does. It usually runs through a list of commands, often taking several
seconds, minutes or even hours, while setting up tons of imperative
state on your system that is hard/annoying to undo. These are exactly
the kinds of tasks that I <em>want</em> to go right on the first try,
much more so than most larger systems even. Trying to restart a
half-finished script that failed <em>somewhere</em> after half an hour,
just because you messed up something simple is a terrible
experience.</p>
