            <p>polaris has algebraic effects, right? how did you implement them?</p>
<p>i know they can be done with free monads but i have a hunch that
that’s not the route you opted to take</p>
        </div>

<p>It doesn’t, actually ^^ I’ve thought about implementing them, but
fine grained effects just aren’t very useful for the kinds of scripts
you might want to write in Polaris and the extra type level complexity
gets in the way too much.</p>
<p>Buut, Vega will have algebraic effects! I’ve also implemented them
for a different language before so I have a pretty good idea of how
they’re going to work.</p>
<p>So, implementing effects on top of free monads is technically
possible, but it’s honestly a pretty terrible idea. I’m not a massive
fan of free monads in general, but building up and later traversing a
heap allocated tree for <em>every</em> effectful expression is pretty
ridiculous.</p>
<p>The standard implementation approaches are much more similar to, or
even based on delimited continuations<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. The key insight here is
that a continuation is really not much more than a call stack and a
<em>delimited</em> continuation (up until an effect handler) is just a
delimited part of the call stack. Therefore, capturing a continuation
just involves copying parts of the stack and continuing just copies them
back. Alexis King has an <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DRFsodbxHQo">amazing talk</a>
about this.</p>
<p>What I’m going to do is based on what <a
href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00250.pdf">OCaml 5</a> does though. The
idea behind this approach is that if a continuation is used
<em>linearly</em> (like the coroutine-like effects that are relevant to
Multicore OCaml), the delimited call stack never actually needs to be
duplicated. So what one can do is represent the program stack as a
hybrid growable/segmented stack where every handler creates a new stack
segment that is linked back to the previous through a pointer. Now
performing an effect walks the stack to find the closest handler (just
like throwing an exception would) and continues execution on
<em>its</em> stack segment. Because there is a segment boundary between
them, nothing in the suspended continuation will be overriden. When the
continuation is resumed, control jumps back forward to the segment where
the effect was performed, which is linked back to the point where the
handler stack has resumed it.</p>
<p>The diagrams in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00250.pdf">the
paper</a> are prettier than this, but you’ll have to bear with my ASCII
art for this example.</p>
<p>Let’s say your program looks something like this, where the
expression at the <code>&lt;--</code> is currently being evaluated</p>
<pre><code>f () = {
    let x = 5
    let returned = handle {
        let y = 6
        let result = perform SomeEffect &lt;---
        result + 1
    } with {
        SomeEffect cont -&gt;
            \x -&gt; continue cont x
        }
    }
    let z = 7
    let w = 8
    returned 9
}</code></pre>
<p>This is a pretty contrived example but all it does is perform an
effect that is handled by returning the continuation as a function,
which is then called with 9 as an argument.</p>
<p>Initially, the call stack for this is going to look something like
this (where stacks grow downwards)</p>
<pre><code>+-------+
| x = 5 |   # the containing function
+-------+
    ^
    |
+-------+
| y = 6 |  # the part inside the handle expression
+-------+ &lt;-- stack ptr</code></pre>
<p>Performing the effect will disconnect the second segment and continue
execution on the initial one while jumping to the correct handler code.
<code>cont</code> is now given a pointer to the disconnected stack
segment (= delimited continuation)</p>
<pre><code>+---------+
| x = 5   |
| cont = ------------------+
+---------+ &lt;-- stack ptr  |
                           |
+---------+                |
| y = 6   | &lt;--------------+
+---------+</code></pre>
<p>The handler further mutates and expands the first stack segment
(which is fine since the second one is completely independent of it
now!). It even returns the continuation wrapped in a function so at the
point just before <code>returned 9</code>, the stack will look like
this</p>
<pre><code>+------------+
| x = 5      |
| returned = ---------------&gt; closure
| z = 7      |                   |
| w = 8      |                   |
+------------+ &lt;-- stack ptr     |
                                 |
+---------+                      |
| y = 6   | &lt;--------------------+
+---------+</code></pre>
<p>Now all that continuing the continuation needs to do is link the
second stack segment back to the first one and jump to the correct
location in the code. It also invalidates the continuation inside
<code>returned</code> since the stack segment will now be mutated and so
cannot be resumed again.</p>
<pre><code>+------------+
| x = 5      |
| returned = ---------------&gt; closure
| z = 7      |                   |
| w = 8      |                   |
+------------+                   X
    ^                            
    |                            X
+---------+                      |
| y = 6   | &lt;--------------------+
+---------+ &lt;-- stack ptr</code></pre>
<p>And that’s it! Notice how none of this ever had to copy stack frames
around or do any operations that were not constant in the size of the
call stack (other than finding the handler which can be done very
efficiently).</p>
<p>Importantly though this approach only works for one-shot
continuations that are only used once. Trying to use the continuation
more than once doesn’t work because the call stack has already been used
up the first time<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In Vega, I’m going to need to have both linear and non-linear effects
anyway since linear resources cannot be carried across calls to
non-linear effects, so I can use that to take this fast path in the
linear case and copy the continuation segment in the non-linear case so
that it can be reused.</p>
<p>Oh and if you’re writing a dumb tree-walk interpreter, CPS is enough
to capture the continuation. That’s how I implemented effects in
Flora.</p>

<li id="fn2"><p>If the continuation is never used, it will stick around
and leak memory. This can be mitigated by registering a finalizer in the
GC and letting it clean up unused continuations, but that has a sizeable
performance cost so it’s not what OCaml does for its rather low level
effects and I have linearity to ensure that they’re used or explicitly
discontinued in Vega.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back"
