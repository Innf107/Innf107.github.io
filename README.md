This is the source code for [my blog](https://prophetlabs.de).

If any of this seems like a massive mess powered by a hacky racket script that was written by someone who doesn't actually know much racket, that's because well... that's exactly what it is!

Where are you ever allowed to hack, if not on your own blog?
